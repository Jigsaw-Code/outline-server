# The maximum number of files that can be opened by ss-server greatly
# influence on performance, as described here:
#   https://shadowsocks.org/en/config/advanced.html
#
# The steps described in that page do *not* work for processes running
# under Docker, at least on modern Debian/Ubuntu-like systems whose init
# daemons allow per-service limits and ignore completely
# /etc/security/limits.conf. On those systems, the Shadowbox container
# will, by default, inherit the limits configured for the Docker service:
#   https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/#set-ulimits-in-container-ulimit
#
# Interestingly, we observed poor performance with large values such as 524288
# and 1048576, the default values in recent releases of Ubuntu. Our
# non-exhaustive testing indicates a performance cliff for Outline after values
# around 270k; to stay well below of this cliff we've semi-handwaved-ly settled
# upon a limit of 32k files.
