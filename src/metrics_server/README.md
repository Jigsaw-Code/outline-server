# Outline Metrics Server

The Outline Metrics Server is a [Google App Engine](https://cloud.google.com/appengine) project that writes feature and connections metrics to BigQuery, as reported by opted-in Outline servers.

## API

### Endpoints

The metrics server deploys two services: `dev`, used for development testing and debugging; and `prod`, used for production metrics. The `dev` environment is deployed to `https://dev.metrics.getoutline.org`; the `prod` environment is deployed to `https://prod.metrics.getoutline.org`. Each environment posts metrics to its own BigQuery dataset (see `config_[dev|prod].json`).

### URLs

The metrics server supports two URL paths:

* `POST /connections`: report server data usage broken down by user.

  ```
  {
    serverId: string,
    startUtcMs: number,
    endUtcMs: number,
    userReports: [{
        userId: string,
        countries: string[],
        bytesTransferred: number,
    }]
  }
  ```
* `POST /features`: report feature usage.

    ```
    {
        serverId: string,
        serverVersion: string,
        timestampUtcMs: number,
        dataLimit: {
            enabled: boolean
        }
    }
    ```
